# Grant macOS Privacy Permissions Script

This shell script allows you to grant **macOS privacy permissions** (such as **Microphone**, **Screen Recording**, **Camera**, and **Accessibility**) to any installed application by modifying the `TCC.db` (Transparency, Consent, and Control database).

It is especially useful for **Hackintosh** users or in cases where macOS fails to show the permission prompt for apps like Slack, Zoom, Chrome, etc.
